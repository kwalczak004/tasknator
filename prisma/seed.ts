      rootCauseSummary: `Analysis of Acme Coffee Shop (Food & Beverage, Austin, TX) reveals several key areas needing attention. The website at acmecoffee.example.com loads adequately but lacks clear calls-to-action above the fold — visitors cannot find an "Order Online" or "Visit Us" button without scrolling. No online ordering capability was detected, which is critical for a food & beverage business in 2026 where 73% of customers expect digital ordering options.

SEO foundations are weak: no blog content, missing meta descriptions on all pages, and no local keyword optimization for high-value terms like "best coffee shop Austin" or "artisan coffee near me." Social media presence is limited to Instagram only (missing Facebook and LinkedIn entirely), though Instagram posting frequency is decent at 2-3 times per week.

The primary challenge of low inbound calls (the business's stated main pain point) is directly linked to an incomplete Google Business Profile and the absence of website conversion paths. The business has only 23 Google reviews after 5+ years of operation — well below the industry average of 80+ for established local businesses.

Recommended priority: (1) Add prominent CTAs and online ordering to the website, (2) Complete and optimize Google Business Profile, (3) Implement a systematic review collection process, (4) Launch a blog targeting local SEO keywords.`,

## Phone Call Script (Catering Inquiry)

**Opening:**
"Hi, thanks for calling Acme Coffee Shop! This is [Name]. How can I help you today?"

**If catering inquiry:**
"Great, we'd love to help with your event! Let me ask a few quick questions:
1. What's the occasion? (meeting, party, event)
2. How many people?
3. When do you need it?
4. Any dietary preferences we should know about?"

**Pitch:**
"Perfect. For [X] people, I'd recommend our [Standard/Premium] catering package. It includes [details]. The total would be around $[X]. We also include branded cups and napkins at no extra charge."

**Close:**
"I can lock in that date for you right now — we just need a 50% deposit. Would you like to go ahead?"

**If they need to think:**
"Of course! I'll send you a quick email summary with photos of our catering setups. What's the best email? I'll also include a 10% early-booking discount code — it's valid for 48 hours."

---

## WhatsApp 3-Message Sequence (Loyalty Signup)

**Message 1 (After first visit):**
"Hey [Name]! Thanks for visiting Acme Coffee today. Did you enjoy your [drink]? Reply YES and I'll send you a free size upgrade for your next visit!"

**Message 2 (After reply):**
"Awesome! Here's your code: SIZEUP. Just show it at the counter next time. By the way, have you heard about Acme Club? For $9.99/month you get unlimited drip coffee, 15% off specialties, and skip-the-line ordering. Want me to sign you up?"

**Message 3 (3 days later if no signup):**
"Just checking in — your SIZEUP code expires in 4 days! Also, this week we're running a special: first month of Acme Club is FREE. That's unlimited coffee for 30 days, no charge. Tap here to join: [link]"

---

## Objection Handling (5 Common Objections)

### 1. "It's too expensive"
**Response:** "I totally get it. Let me show you the math — if you buy just one drip coffee a day at $3.50, that's $105/month. Acme Club is $9.99 for unlimited drip coffee. You'd save over $95 every month. It literally pays for itself after 3 visits."

### 2. "I don't come here often enough"
**Response:** "That's actually the best reason to try it. With Acme Club, you also get 15% off specialty drinks and skip-the-line ordering. Even if you come twice a week, you're saving money. Plus, the first month is free — so you can test it with zero risk."

### 3. "I can get coffee at Starbucks for cheaper"
**Response:** "Totally valid — but here's the difference: our beans are roasted within 48 hours, from single-origin farms. Starbucks buys in bulk and roasts months in advance. Once you taste the difference, it's hard to go back. And with Acme Club, our daily drip is actually cheaper than Starbucks."

### 4. "I need to ask my partner/boss" (for catering)
**Response:** "Of course! I'll email you a one-page proposal with pricing, photos, and a testimonial from [similar business]. There's also a 10% early-booking discount included — valid for 48 hours. What's the best email to send it to?"

### 5. "We already have a coffee supplier" (for corporate)
**Response:** "That makes sense. Can I ask — are you happy with the quality and service? A lot of our corporate clients switched because we deliver fresh-roasted coffee daily (not weekly) and we include a free team tasting experience. I'd love to drop off a sample box — no obligation. Can I schedule that for this week?"

---

## KPI Target
Close rate +20% — measured by tracking catering inquiries to bookings and loyalty signups per month.

## Deploy Steps
1. Print phone script and place at register for staff reference
2. Set up WhatsApp Business account with auto-greeting
3. Create 3-message sequence in WhatsApp Business flow
4. Train all baristas on the 5 objection responses (15-min team huddle)
5. Role-play scenarios during weekly team meeting
6. Track weekly: loyalty signups, catering inquiries, close rates
7. A/B test the WhatsApp sequence: try "first month free" vs "50% off first month"`,

We don't do "coffee flavor." We do coffee.

      excerpt: "Most small businesses make the same critical mistakes with their online presence. Here's what our data from 10,000+ audits reveals.",
      content: `## The Silent Killer of Small Businesses

Every year, thousands of small businesses invest in websites, social media, and digital marketing — only to see little to no return. After analyzing over 10,000 businesses through Recovra.ai's AI audit system, we've identified the top reasons why.

### 1. No Clear Call-to-Action

**68% of small business websites** lack a clear, compelling call-to-action above the fold. Visitors land on the page and have no idea what to do next.

**The Fix:** Every page should have ONE primary action you want visitors to take. Whether it's "Book a Free Consultation" or "Get Your Quote," make it impossible to miss.

### 2. Missing Meta Descriptions

**54% of audited businesses** have incomplete or missing meta descriptions. This means Google is generating snippets for them — often poorly.

**The Fix:** Write compelling meta descriptions for every page. Keep them under 160 characters and include your target keyword naturally.

### 3. No Google Business Profile

**41% of local businesses** either don't have a Google Business Profile or haven't optimized it. This is free real estate on the world's largest search engine.

**The Fix:** Claim your profile, add photos weekly, respond to every review, and keep your hours updated.

### 4. Inconsistent Social Presence

Having accounts on every platform but posting once a month is worse than not being there at all. **Focus on 2 platforms** where your customers actually spend time.

### 5. No Review Strategy

**82% of consumers** read online reviews before visiting a business. Yet most businesses leave their reputation to chance.

**The Fix:** Implement a systematic review-request process. Recovra.ai's Reputation Fixer module can generate review-request campaigns automatically.

## The AI Advantage

What used to take a marketing agency weeks to diagnose, AI can now do in minutes. Recovra.ai's AI audit scans your entire digital presence and gives you a prioritized repair plan — so you fix what matters most, first.

      content: `## Marketing Mistakes That Kill Revenue

Running a business is hard enough without marketing working against you. Here are 5 mistakes we see in nearly every audit — and how to fix them fast.

### Mistake #1: Targeting Everyone

When you try to appeal to everyone, you appeal to no one. The most successful businesses we've audited have a crystal-clear ideal customer profile.

**Action item:** Write down exactly who your best customer is. Age, income, location, pain points, and where they spend time online.

### Mistake #2: No Email List

Social media followers aren't yours — they're rented. If Instagram changes its algorithm tomorrow, your reach could drop 90%. An email list is the only audience you truly own.

**Action item:** Set up an email capture form on your website with a compelling lead magnet. Even a simple "10% off your first order" works.

### Mistake #3: Ignoring Reviews

Negative reviews happen to every business. What matters is how you respond. Ignoring them signals to potential customers that you don't care.

**Action item:** Respond to every review (positive and negative) within 24 hours. Be professional, empathetic, and solution-oriented.

### Mistake #4: No Follow-Up System

80% of sales require 5+ touchpoints, yet most businesses give up after 1-2. Without a follow-up system, you're leaving money on the table.

**Action item:** Set up an automated email sequence for new leads. Recovra.ai can generate these sequences for you based on your business type.

### Mistake #5: Copying Competitors

Your competitors might be making the same mistakes you are. Instead of copying, focus on what makes YOU different.

**Action item:** List 3 things that make your business unique. Build your marketing around those differentiators.
